/*
Given an arbitrary target string and another string of lyrics, write a function that returns a boolean of whether or not the target string can be formulated from the lyrics.

Each letter in the lyrics string can only be used once in your target string.

Note: Assume both inputs will be valid strings.

Examples:

let target = 'Hack Reactor'
let good_kid_chorus = 'Mass hallucination baby Ill education baby Want to reconnect with your elations This is your station baby';
can_formulate(target, good_kid_chorus); => return false

let target = 'Kendrick Lamar';
let now_or_never_verse = 'Waking up in a dream Sleepwalking on another big stage You never heard peace til you hear people scream Your name in unison';
can_formulate(target, now_or_never_verse); => return true
*/

/**
 * @param {string} target
 * @param {string} lyrics
 * @return {boolean}
 */

const can_formulate = (target, lyrics) => {};

export default can_formulate;
